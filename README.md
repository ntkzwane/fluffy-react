# Fluffy React
This application is used as the demo for [this](https://slides.com/ntokozozwane/reactjs-over-the-hype-and-under-the-hood)
presentation for entry-level React users. It is split up into three sub-apps:

1. Basic react component
2. Multiple react components with coupled state
2. Multiple react components with coupled state managed by Redux

## Running it
First, install dependencies through
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn
```

Then to start up the first app for the first scenario, run:
```
npm run start:one
```
or
```
yarn start:one
```

and the second and third sub-apps can be started with a similar script just replacing `:one` with `:two` or `:three`.
